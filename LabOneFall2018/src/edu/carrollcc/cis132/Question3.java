 * Question 3 [10 Points]
 *  
 * The following program has been mixed up and it will not compile.
 * Without changing the text, add indentation for readability and move the lines 
 * into the correct order so the program output looks like this:
 * 
 * CHEESEBURGER
 * CHEESEBURGER 
 * CHEESEBURGER CHEESEBURGER
 * 
 * CHEESEBURGER
 * (HINT #1: Remove only the comment block lines indicated by "REMOVE THIS LINE" to
 * uncomment the code. You will see lots of errors)
 * (HINT #2: The comment should be the first line)
 * Test your program by compiling and running it.
