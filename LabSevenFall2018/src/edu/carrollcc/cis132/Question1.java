 * Question 1 [20 Points]
 * ScanBot Class
 * 
 * The school has asked you to write a program that grades the multiple choice 
 * portion of a final exam. The exam has 20 multiple choice questions. 
 * Here are the correct answers:
 * 
 * 1. B 
 * 2. D 
 * 3. A 
 * 4. A 
 * 5. C 
 * 6. A
 * 7. B
 * 8. A
 * 9. C
 * 10. D
 * 11. B
 * 12. C
 * 13. D
 * 14. A
 * 15. D
 * 16. C
 * 17. C
 * 18. B
 * 19. D
 * 20. A
 * 
 * 
 * Write a class named ScanBot in the edu.carrollcc.cis132.q1 package that 
 * holds the correct answers to the exam in an array field.
 *
 * The class also should have the following instance methods: 
 * (HINT: One argument/parameter should be an array of student answers.)
 * 
 * 1. totalCorrect: Returns the total number of correctly answered questions
 * as an integer.
 * 
 * 2. percentGrade: Returns floating point value of the percent of questions 
 * the student got correct. Don't forget to convert it to a percent value - 
 * so don't return .9867, you return 98.67 
 * (Hint: use the totalIncorrect method)
 * 
 * 3. letterGrade: Returns a character representing the letter grade the student got on the exam.
 * (Hint: use percentGrade method)
 * 90 up to and including 100 = A
 * 80 up to 90 = B
 * 70 up to 80 = C
 * 60 up to 70 = D
 * Less than 60 = F
 * 

 *  
 * Demonstrate the class in a complete program that asks the user to enter a 
 * student's answers, and then displays the results returned from the 
 * ScanBot class's methods. 
 * OUTPUT: Use text to make the output meaningful, do not just print letters and numbers.
 * Format your floating point output values to 2 decimal places. Also, if using
 * printf and you want to print the percent sign, use %%
 * You should print the percentage, the letter grade and the number of incorrect answers out of 20.
 * 
 * Input Validation: Only accept the letters A, B, C, or D as answers. User should be limited
 * to entering 20 values.
 *
 * Comments and style are worth up to 2 points.
 * Include JAVADOC comments in your class explaining your methods
